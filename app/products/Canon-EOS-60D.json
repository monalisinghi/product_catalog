    "description": "With the EOS 60D, you can discover your potential and take your photography further. Helping you to capture every image the way you imagine it, this Digital SLR Camera uses a 18MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DiG!C 4 imaging processor to create low noise images with beautiful resolution, even in low light. Even if you are shooting from an awkward angle, you can position the camera’s 3.0” vari-angle LCD monitor to make sure you get the shot just right. And with a camera that shoots up to 5.3 frames per second, you will never miss a shot either! The EOS 60D also features 9-point Auto Focus and LiveView with face detection, so you can find the perfect focus when taking both stills and movie.",
